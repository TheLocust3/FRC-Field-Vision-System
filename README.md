# FRC Field Vision System
  
### What is it?  
A vision system to detect field elements and robots. Built to be used with [FRC-AI-Engine](https://github.com/TheLocust3/FRC-AI-Engine) which is meant to run a robot completely autonomously. In the end, it will be run on a Raspberry Pi, and will send data over SmartDashboard.

### To-Do  
 - Create flattener to flatten field coordinates
 - Tune ball and robot detectors
 - Make robot detector faster
 - Detect if hoppers are empty
 - Create sender to send over socket
 - Create sender to send over SmartDashboard
 - Create vision system for a camera mounted to the robot
 - Create a tuning system
